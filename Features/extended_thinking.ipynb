    "# When to Use Extended Thinking\n",
    "The decision is straightforward: use your prompt evaluations. Run your prompts without thinking first, and if the accuracy isn't meeting your requirements after you've already optimized your prompt, then consider enabling extended thinking. It's a tool for when standard prompting isn't quite getting you there."
