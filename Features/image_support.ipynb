    "   - Distinction from other structures (garages, sheds, pools)\n",

    "   - Areas where branches create a \"bridge\" between wildland vegetation and the structure\n",

    "   - Rating 1 (Low Risk): No tree branches overhanging the roof, good defensible space around the structure\n",
    "   - Rating 2 (Moderate Risk): Minimal overhang (<25% of roof), some separation between tree canopies\n",
